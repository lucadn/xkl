<h1>Sample File Upload Form</h1>

<p><b>NOTE: This script is <i>not</i> operative on this server.
You must install it on your own server in order to see it operate.</b>


<p>This page allows you to upload a file.  Note that the script will
limit the size of the file to around 50k (so that the server doesn't
get swamped with data).


<p>The file upload form looks just like any other form except that:
<ol>
<li> the form tag must specify the <tt>POST</tt> method
<li> the form tag must specify an enctype of <tt>multipart/form-data</tt>
<li> the form must contain an <tt>&lt;input type=file&gt;</tt> element.
</ol>
You can do a view source on this document to see all the elements.

<p>The processing of a file upload is exactly like that of ordinary
data; just make a call to <b><tt>ReadParse</b></tt> and the data will
either be put in <tt>%in</tt> or some other variable that you specify.
If you want to write files to disk (rather than store the data in
memory), then you also need to set the variable
<tt>$cgi_lib'writefiles</tt> to indicate the directory where the data
should be written.  Other variables allow you to further customize the
file upload.
